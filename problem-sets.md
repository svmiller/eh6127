Here are the five problem sets you'll need to complete through the course. Observe the deadlines for these problem sets in the course description.

I've attached an answer template for your consideration as well. Download this file (i.e. right-click the link and save): [`eh6127-ps1-svensson-sven.Rmd`](http://eh6127.svmiller.com/problem-sets/1/eh6127-ps1-svensson-sven.Rmd). Open it in Rstudio, take a quick look at its contents, and then press the "Knit" button. In the same directory in which you saved the R Markdown file, there'll be a corresponding Word document. Open that in your Word document reader to see what you did. From there, you might be able to follow your intuition as to what's happening. You can [read more about R Markdown here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown).

### [Problem Set #1](http://eh6105.svmiller.com/problem-sets/1/eh6105-ps1.pdf)

The first problem set makes use of the [Systemic Banking Crises Database II](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/SBCD.html) in [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata) to learn about basic data summary, data exploration, and data manipulation.


### [Problem Set #2](http://eh6105.svmiller.com/problem-sets/2/eh6105-ps2.pdf)

The second problem set makes use of the [National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/nesarc_drinkspd.html) data set in [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata) to learn about basic descriptive statistics, recoding things, and, importantly, how you should always read the codebook.


### [Problem Set #3](http://eh6105.svmiller.com/problem-sets/3/eh6105-ps3.pdf)

The third problem set makes use of some data available in [`{peacesciencer}`](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer) to learn bivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.


### [Problem Set #4](http://eh6105.svmiller.com/problem-sets/4/eh6105-ps4.pdf)

The fourth problem set makes use of [some simple (American) presidential election data](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/election_turnout.html) in [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata) to learn about simple derivations of the OLS model (e.g. controls, fixed effects).

### [Problem Set #5](http://eh6105.svmiller.com/problem-sets/5/eh6105-ps5.pdf)

The final problem set makes use of [General Social Survey (GSS) data on attitudes about government spending](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/gss_spending.html) in [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata) to learn about OLS model diagnostics. Students will also have the option of bootstrapping their regression model here if they want to go hardcore in the last question. Nothing in the course plan said I couldn't have you choose this path if I wanted.  ðŸ˜œ
